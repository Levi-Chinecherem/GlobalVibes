General idea of globalVibes blogging system:
we are going to build a complex blogging system, part by part until its complete
we will use django, tailwind css, jquery ajax to prevent page reload before data are updated, their will be paginations, filtering and searching of blogs etc
so you will help me as we craft this system from ground up, below are the features of this system, we will build it app after app, lets begin with the accounts app


Inside the accounts app
CustomUser model:
allow user upload their profile image, promoter(which remains false until admin adds the user to the promoters list in the promoters app, then it updates to true automatically)
also make user login with email instead of username, and username, along side their password too etc

add cutomManager too


Inside notification app

add a notification system, push notification, such that actions from any app within the system can send their notifications and they will all be in one notification model, for easy access, include the notification count, red (true or false depending if user have viewed or red it)
always add link to the notification, to allow user to go view them, like if its a comment on any blog, add link to that blog so that user can easily access it.


Inside blog app

Category model:
title

Tags model:
title


Blog model:
title
category (relate to category model)
cover_image
content
created_at
author (relation to user)
tags (relation to tags model, allow one blog to relate to many tags)


Comment model:
source (relate to user dropping the comment)
blog (relate to blog recieving the comment, that is the blog that the user is dropping the comment on)
commentary
created_at

Like model:
source (relate to user dropping the comment)
blog (relate to blog recieving the comment, that is the blog that the user is dropping the comment on)
like (true or false)
created_at


add verbose singular and plural names to all the models and __str__ method too

More:
i'll like a situation whereby users can also reply to follow users comments, by typing @ then the users name, to target that particular user, i'll like to have a share button button too when clicked should copy the blog url to clipboard and return a flash message saying copied, that is on the template side

push a notification, to notify all users through notification app about a new blog, and comments on a any blog, and especially when the @username is used notify that particular user about the comment and the blog

again the filtering ill like for the blogs are:
today's posts
yesterday's post
by category
by tags
by date range, that is from so date to so date, return all blogs that existss within those days (created_at)
then search by any blog model fields


Inside promoters app
promoters model:
name (relation to the user being promoted)

anyone in the promoters list can create a blog, create communities and manage blog and communities, and anyone made a promoter should have that label on them, that is update their customUser model to make promoter true


Inside community app:


community model:
title
cover_image
description


ill like to have a chatting system in the community to allow admin or anyone promoted to the level of promoter to be able to create communities, delete communities, update etc. they can also approve users request to join any community, and then the general users can join each community and chat in the community they have joined, remember to add notification system for this too,
